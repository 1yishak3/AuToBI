Some build notes:

The lib file contains the distributions of some (but not all) dependency jars. 

build.xml contains the list of all the dependent libraries required and their correct versions. 
Download them and place it in the lib folder.

Start a new project using ANT build in Eclipse and run an ANT build for build.xml.

The ouput is AuToBI.jar, which can be run in the command line as indicated in the manual.
